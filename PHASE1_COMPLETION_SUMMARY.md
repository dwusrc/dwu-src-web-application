# 🚀 Phase 1 Completion Summary - SRC Projects Feature

## ✅ **What We've Accomplished**

### **1. Database Schema Setup**
- ✅ Created comprehensive SQL migration script (`src_projects_migration.sql`)
- ✅ Added "President" department to SRC departments
- ✅ Created `src_projects` table with all necessary fields
- ✅ Implemented proper enums for project status and approval status
- ✅ Added performance indexes and RLS policies
- ✅ Created database view for easy querying

### **2. TypeScript Types Updated**
- ✅ Replaced old `ProjectProposal` interface with new `SrcProject` types
- ✅ Added `ProjectStatus` and `ApprovalStatus` enums
- ✅ Created `SrcProjectWithRelations` type for API responses
- ✅ Added `SrcProjectFormData` interface for form submissions

### **3. Complete API Backend**
- ✅ **Main Route** (`/api/src-projects`)
  - GET: Public view (approved projects only)
  - POST: SRC members create projects (pending approval)
- ✅ **Admin Route** (`/api/src-projects/admin`)
  - GET: Admin view (all projects with approval queue)
- ✅ **Individual Project Routes** (`/api/src-projects/[id]`)
  - GET: View single project
  - PUT: Update project (SRC/Admin)
  - DELETE: Delete project (SRC own projects, Admin any)
- ✅ **Approval Routes**
  - PUT `/approve`: Admin approves projects
  - PUT `/reject`: Admin rejects projects with reason

### **4. Frontend Components Started**
- ✅ **SRC Project Form** (`src-project-form.tsx`)
  - Complete form with validation
  - Team member management
  - Date and budget inputs
  - Form submission handling

## 🔐 **Security & Access Control Implemented**

### **Student Permissions:**
- ✅ View approved projects only
- ❌ Create/edit/delete projects

### **SRC Member Permissions:**
- ✅ Create projects (pending approval)
- ✅ Edit approved projects from their department
- ✅ **Delete their own projects** (as requested)
- ❌ Approve/reject projects

### **Admin Permissions:**
- ✅ View all projects (including pending)
- ✅ Approve/reject all projects
- ✅ Delete any project
- ✅ Full project management

## 🏗️ **Database Structure**

### **Core Fields:**
- `id`, `department_id`, `title`, `description`, `objectives`
- `start_date`, `target_finish_date`, `actual_finish_date`
- `progress_percentage`, `budget_allocated`, `budget_spent`
- `team_members[]`, `status`, `approval_status`
- `approved_by`, `approved_at`, `rejection_reason`
- `created_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### **Status Enums:**
- **Project Status:** `not_started`, `planning`, `in_progress`, `on_hold`, `completed`, `cancelled`
- **Approval Status:** `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`

### **Relationships:**
- Links to `src_departments` table
- Links to `profiles` table (created_by, approved_by)
- Proper foreign key constraints and indexes

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Phase 2**

### **Frontend Components Needed:**
1. **Project List Component** - Display approved projects for students
2. **Project View Component** - Detailed project view
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Approval queue and project management
4. **SRC Dashboard** - Project management for SRC members

### **Dashboard Integration:**
1. **Student Dashboard** - Add SRC Projects tab
2. **SRC Dashboard** - Add project management interface
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Add approval queue

### **Testing & Validation:**
1. Test database migration
2. Test API endpoints
3. Test form submission
4. Test approval workflow

## 🚀 **How to Deploy Phase 1**

### **1. Run Database Migration:**
```bash
# Execute the SQL script in your Supabase database
psql -h your-supabase-host -U your-username -d your-database -f src_projects_migration.sql
```

### **2. Verify Database Setup:**
- Check if `src_projects` table exists
- Verify "President" department was added
- Confirm RLS policies are active
- Test basic CRUD operations

### **3. Test API Endpoints:**
- Test project creation (SRC role)
- Test project viewing (all roles)
- Test admin approval/rejection
- Test project updates and deletion

## ✅ **Phase 1 Success Criteria Met**

- ✅ Database schema created with proper structure
- ✅ All API routes implemented with proper security
- ✅ TypeScript types updated and comprehensive
- ✅ Basic form component created
- ✅ RLS policies implemented for all user roles
- ✅ Approval workflow backend complete
- ✅ SRC can delete their own projects (as requested)

**Phase 1 is complete and ready for deployment! The foundation is solid and we can now move to Phase 2: Frontend Components and Dashboard Integration.**

**Next: Create the project list, view components, and integrate with existing dashboards.**
